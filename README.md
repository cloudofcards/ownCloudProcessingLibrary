Cloud of Cards, a home cloud kit to re-appropriate your data self, is the principal outcome of the joint design & ethnographic research Inhabiting and Interfacing the Cloud(s). It is accompanied by two print-on-demand books that document its creation.
The main results of the project consist of four digital and physical artefacts, forming a set of modular tools (‘cards’) that are delivered in the form of an open-source DIY kit, freely accessible at www.cloudofcards.org and on Github for its related code. The purpose of these tools is to enable everyone, in particular the community of designers and makers, to set up their own small-scale data-center and cloud, manage their data in a decentralized way and develop their own alternative projects using this small-scale personal infrastructure.

The joint design and ethnographic research project was led at ECAL / University of Art & Design, Lausanne by Prof Patrick Keller and at HEAD – Genève by Prof Nicolas Nova, with the support of HES-SO / University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland.
The project is based on ownCloud open-source software. All results and outcomes are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

Cloud of Cards Processing Library consists of the unification of three different APIs dedicated to online file and folder manipulation and the development of a fourth additional API specific to the needs of the Cloud of Cards kit and the Inhabiting and Interfacing the Cloud(s) research project.
The final overall package has been adapted to the development language Processing and linked to ownCloud open-source cloud software.
Additional behaviors have been included that can also be used with ownCloud (or Nextcloud), in both its server and clients. These additional functions are the result of implementing the findings from the process of the  design research Inhabiting and Interfacing the Cloud(s) and from a related ethnographic study about cloud user experience.
This new library written in Processing and linked to other open-source tools now makes it easier for a wider public to experiment, sketch and develop alternative interfaces and visual or physical applications for the cloud. It is of particular use to communities of designers and makers acquainted with Processing as a programming language.

The project was developed by Dr. Christian Babski (fabric | ch)
