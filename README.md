/*
 * 	This library allows to connect to a Owncloud server programmatically. It
 *  is then possible to computerise the copy/move/upload/download of Owncloud's
 *  files and in a more general way manage an Owncloud account's files
 *  (including sharing files, adding meta information on files and search
 *  among them).
 *  By setting up several connections to several Owncloud servers, it is
 *  possible to manage files through distinct Owncloud servers
 *  programmatically.
 *  
 *  It is based on:
 *  - Owncloud : A files manager and sharing server
 *  http://owncloud.org
 *  
 *  - Sardine : a WebDAV implementation library
 *  https://github.com/lookfirst/sardine
 *  			
 *  - OCS Share : Owncloud file sharing API
 *  http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html
 *  
 *  - OCS User Provisioning API
 *  https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/configuration_user/user_provisioning_api.html
